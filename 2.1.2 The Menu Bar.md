The menus and commands available on the menu bar are described below.

A number of menu bar commands can also be executed by clicking their associated icon buttons on the toolbar. In addition, menus and commands with shortcut keys displayed next to them can be selected by pressing the associated keys.

This means there are a number of ways to execute the same command. For example, to execute the Undo command, you can click Undo on the Edit menu, hold down the CTRL key while pressing the Z key (CTRL+Z), or click the Undo button on the toolbar.
